## About Me

I am a final-year PhD student under the supervision of Prof. Stefanie Speidel at the [National Center for Tumor Diseases (NCT)](https://www.nct-dresden.de/forschung/departments-and-groups/department-for-translational-surgical-oncology.html) and the [Centre for Tactile Internet (CeTI)](https://ceti.one/) of TU Dresden, Germany.

My research is located in Video Understanding as well as Neural Rendering for Surgical Computer Vision applications. I am interested in the intersection of academic and application-driven research and aim to identify gaps between common Computer Vision methods and surgical applications.

## Research Interests

- **Video Understanding:** procedural video understanding, surgical workflow analysis
- **Video Synthesis:** unsupervised neural rendering for video synthesis, generative models
